# 🧬 DNA Data Storage System

An AI-inspired bioinformatics system that **encodes digital data into DNA sequences and decodes it back without data loss** using error-correction and nucleotide balancing techniques.



## 📌 Problem Statement

Current storage devices (HDD/SSD/data centers) have limited lifespan, require high energy and large space, and cannot keep up with rapidly growing global data. Therefore, a more dense, durable, and sustainable storage medium is needed.


## 💡 Solution

This project simulates **DNA-based data storage**:

* Converts binary data → DNA nucleotides (A, T, C, G)
* Applies encoding rules to reduce mutations & sequencing errors
* Adds redundancy for error correction
* Decodes DNA back → original data



## 🧠 Technologies Used

* Python
* Java Script
* HTML
* CSS
* GitHub



## 🧪 Dataset

No traditional dataset is required.

The system generates DNA strands from:

* User text input
* Binary data
* Validation sequences



## 🔄 Working Flow

1. User inputs text/data
2. Data converts to binary
3. Binary encoded into DNA sequence
4. Error-correction bases added
5. DNA stored (simulated)
6. DNA decoded back to binary
7. Original data reconstructed



## ▶️ Example Output

**Input:** HELLO
**Binary:** 01001000 01000101 01001100 01001100 01001111
**DNA Sequence:** ATCGGCTAATCG...
**Decoded Output:** HELLO ✔ (No Data Loss)



## 🔒 Key Features

* Lossless data recovery
* Mutation-safe encoding
* GC-content balancing
* Long-term archival storage simulation
